\section{Introduction}

The Sleeping Beauty problem is a puzzle in probability theory and epistemology
first discussed by Arnold Zuboff and later popularized by Adam Elga in 2000.

The setup is as follows: Sleeping Beauty is put to sleep on Sunday. A fair coin
is flipped. If the coin lands \textbf{Heads}, Beauty is woken once on Monday,
then the experiment ends. If the coin lands \textbf{Tails}, Beauty is woken on
Monday, put back to sleep with her memory of the waking erased, then woken
again on Tuesday. 

Upon each awakening, Beauty is asked: \emph{What is your credence that the coin
landed Heads?}. She does not get told either the outcome of the coin flip 
or what day it is until she states her credence. 

There are two main positions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Halfers} argue the answer is $\frac{1}{2}$, since the coin is
        fair and no new information is gained upon waking.
  \item \textbf{Thirders} argue the answer is $\frac{1}{3}$, since upon waking
        there are three equally likely situations (Heads/Monday,
        Tails/Monday, Tails/Tuesday), only one of which corresponds to Heads.
\end{itemize}

\section{Formalisation}

\begin{code}

module SleepingBeauty where

open import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality using (_≡_; refl; sym; trans; cong; cong₂)
open import Data.Product using (Σ; _×_; _,_; proj₁; proj₂)
open import Data.Sum     using (_⊎_; inj₁; inj₂)
open import Data.Empty   using (⊥; ⊥-elim)
open import Data.Unit    using (⊤; tt)

\end{code}

\subsection{Sample space}

The sample space $\Omega$ for the Sleeping Beauty problem is the set of all
\emph{(coin outcome, day)} pairs that can arise during the experiment.

\begin{code}

data CoinFlip : Set where
  heads : CoinFlip
  tails : CoinFlip

data Day : Set where
  monday  : Day
  tuesday : Day

Ω : Set
Ω = CoinFlip × Day

\end{code}

\subsection{Events as predicates}

Following \texttt{CategoricalCrypto.ProbabilisticLogic}, events are
predicates $\Omega \to \mathsf{Set}$.

\begin{code}

-- Set-theoretic operations on events
_∩_ _∪_ : (Ω → Set) → (Ω → Set) → Ω → Set
(X ∩ Y) ω = X ω × Y ω
(X ∪ Y) ω = X ω ⊎ Y ω

∅ U : Ω → Set
∅ _ = ⊥
U _ = ⊤

disjoint : (X Y : Ω → Set) → Set
disjoint X Y = ∀ {ω} → X ω → Y ω → ⊥

-- A binary partition of Ω
record Partition (X Y : Ω → Set) : Set where
  field
    disj   : disjoint X Y
    covers : ∀ ω → X ω ⊎ Y ω

-- The four basic SB events
IsTails IsHeads IsMonday IsTuesday : Ω → Set
IsTails   (c , _) = c ≡ tails
IsHeads   (c , _) = c ≡ heads
IsMonday  (_ , d) = d ≡ monday
IsTuesday (_ , d) = d ≡ tuesday

\end{code}

\subsection{Abstract probability frame}

We work parametrically over an \emph{abstract probability frame}, which
captures the axioms of the \texttt{Abstract} record from
\texttt{CategoricalCrypto.ProbabilisticLogic} that we actually need.
The two load-bearing axioms are the conditional-probability identity and
finite additivity for disjoint events.

\begin{code}

-- Abstract probability type — we leave it abstract so the module can be
-- instantiated with ℚ or any other probability semiring.
record ProbFrame : Set₁ where
  field
    Prob   : Set
    _⊕_    : Prob → Prob → Prob   -- addition of probabilities
    _⊗_    : Prob → Prob → Prob   -- multiplication of probabilities
    0p 1p ½p : Prob

    -- Distributions over Ω
    Distr  : Set
    _∙_    : Distr → (Ω → Set) → Prob

    -- Conditional distribution P ∣ X, viewed back on Ω
    _∣_    : Distr → (X : Ω → Set) → Distr

    -- Axioms (from Abstract in ProbabilisticLogic.agda)
    cond-prob      : ∀ {P : Distr} {X Y : Ω → Set}
                   → (P ∙ X) ⊗ ((P ∣ X) ∙ Y)  ≡  P ∙ (X ∩ Y)

    disjoint-add   : ∀ {P : Distr} {X Y : Ω → Set}
                   → disjoint X Y
                   → (P ∙ X) ⊕ (P ∙ Y)  ≡  P ∙ (X ∪ Y)

    -- Distributions respect extensional equality of events
    ∙-cong         : ∀ {P : Distr} {X Y : Ω → Set}
                   → (∀ ω → X ω → Y ω) → (∀ ω → Y ω → X ω)
                   → P ∙ X ≡ P ∙ Y

    -- Rational arithmetic laws (hold when Prob = ℚ)
    mul-1p     : ∀ (x : Prob) → x ⊗ 1p ≡ x
    ½-cancel   : ∀ {x y : Prob} → x ⊗ ½p ≡ y ⊗ ½p → x ≡ y
    ½-double   : ∀ (x : Prob) → ((x ⊗ ½p) ⊕ (x ⊗ ½p)) ≡ x
    ⊕-cancel-r : ∀ {x y z : Prob} → (x ⊕ z) ≡ (y ⊕ z) → x ≡ y

\end{code}

\subsection{Chapman–Kolmogorov / law of total probability}

For a binary partition $\{X, Y\}$ of $\Omega$ the \emph{law of total
probability} reads
\[
  P(Z) \;=\; P(X)\cdot P(Z\mid X) \;+\; P(Y)\cdot P(Z\mid Y).
\]
In the abstract frame this is a consequence of \texttt{cond-prob} and
\texttt{disjoint-add}; it instantiates the Chapman–Kolmogorov identity for
Kleisli composition in the probability monad (see nLab: \emph{monads of
probability, measures, and valuations}).

\begin{code}

module ChapmanKolmogorov (F : ProbFrame) where
  open ProbFrame F

  -- The Chapman–Kolmogorov law of total probability for a binary partition.
  --
  --   P ∙ Z  =  (P ∙ X) ⊗ ((P ∣ X) ∙ Z)  ⊕  (P ∙ Y) ⊗ ((P ∣ Y) ∙ Z)
  --
  ck : ∀ (P : Distr) {X Y : Ω → Set} (Z : Ω → Set)
     → Partition X Y
     → (((P ∙ X) ⊗ ((P ∣ X) ∙ Z)) ⊕ ((P ∙ Y) ⊗ ((P ∣ Y) ∙ Z))) ≡ (P ∙ Z)
  ck P {X} {Y} Z part =
    trans (cong₂ _⊕_ cond-prob cond-prob)
    (trans (disjoint-add dXZ-YZ)
           (∙-cong {P = P} {X = (X ∩ Z) ∪ (Y ∩ Z)} {Y = Z} bwd fwd))
    where
      dXZ-YZ : disjoint (X ∩ Z) (Y ∩ Z)
      dXZ-YZ (xω , _) (yω , _) = Partition.disj part xω yω
      bwd : ∀ ω → ((X ∩ Z) ∪ (Y ∩ Z)) ω → Z ω
      bwd ω (inj₁ (_ , zω)) = zω
      bwd ω (inj₂ (_ , zω)) = zω
      fwd : ∀ ω → Z ω → ((X ∩ Z) ∪ (Y ∩ Z)) ω
      fwd ω zω with Partition.covers part ω
      ... | inj₁ xω = inj₁ (xω , zω)
      ... | inj₂ yω = inj₂ (yω , zω)

\end{code}

\subsection{Application to Sleeping Beauty}

We now instantiate \texttt{ck} for the two Chapman–Kolmogorov identities
that govern the Sleeping Beauty problem.

\begin{code}

-- Halfer priors: the coin is fair (P(Heads) = 1/2 as a marginal),
-- plus the uncontroversial structural facts about the experiment.

\subsection{What the two protocols are counting}

The halfer and thirder positions are not merely different answers to the same question: they
reflect different choices of \emph{what} the probability measure $\mu$ is defined over.
The halfer treats each \emph{experiment run} as a single unit of probability mass.
Because the coin is fair, exactly half of all runs land Heads, so the marginal weight of
Heads waking occasions is $\frac{1}{2}$.
Tails runs are weighted the same as Heads runs, but each Tails run produces \emph{two}
waking occasions; the measure is therefore concentrated on runs, not wakings.

The thirder, by contrast, assigns equal weight to each \emph{waking occasion}.
Under this accounting there are three equally-possible situations
(Heads/Monday, Tails/Monday, Tails/Tuesday), so each carries weight $\frac{1}{3}$.

The thirder position can be motivated by a \emph{self-locating indifference} principle:
upon learning a piece of information, distribute weight equally over all waking occasions
consistent with that information.
Applied to the day: Tuesday is consistent with only one occasion (Tails/Tuesday), so
learning it is Tuesday collapses all weight there; Monday is consistent with two occasions
(Heads/Monday and Tails/Monday), so each receives weight $\frac{1}{2}$.
Applied to the coin: Heads is consistent with only one occasion (Heads/Monday), leaving
no residual uncertainty about the day; Tails is consistent with two occasions
(Tails/Monday and Tails/Tuesday), so each receives weight $\frac{1}{2}$.
This principle immediately yields all four of the thirder's priors, including
\texttt{tails-given-monday}$\;=\tfrac{1}{2}$.

The halfer rejects this last step.
Under the halfer's measure, Heads/Monday carries weight $\frac{1}{2}$ and Tails/Monday
carries weight $\frac{1}{4}$, so $P(\mathrm{Tails}\mid\mathrm{Monday}) = \tfrac{1/4}{3/4} = \tfrac{1}{3}$,
not $\tfrac{1}{2}$.
The halfer distribution is not uniform over waking occasions, so equal weight to
remaining compatible scenarios fails when conditioning on the day.
In the formalization this is exactly the one field where the two records diverge:
\texttt{ThirderPriors} asserts \texttt{tails-given-monday}$\;=\tfrac{1}{2}$,
while \texttt{HalferPriors} replaces it with the marginal constraint
\texttt{heads-prior}$\;=\tfrac{1}{2}$, which is incompatible with the indifference
principle above.

Formally, the disagreement surfaces as a contradiction: no single distribution
$\mu$ can satisfy \texttt{HalferPriors} and \texttt{ThirderPriors} simultaneously.
The halfer's constraint \texttt{heads-prior} pins the marginal $\mu({\rm Heads}) = \tfrac{1}{2}$,
whereas \texttt{tails-twice-heads} derived from the thirder's constraint forces
$\mu({\rm Tails}) = 2\,\mu({\rm Heads})$; together with normalization these two claims
are inconsistent.
The two records therefore do not describe competing beliefs about the same probability
space --- they describe \emph{different probability spaces} built from the same sample
space $\Omega$, one weighted by runs and one weighted by wakings.
